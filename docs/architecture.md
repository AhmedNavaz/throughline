# Architecture

Throughline is a local desktop application: an Electron shell, a Node.js HTTP server and a static JavaScript interface. There is no frontend build step. The optional sharing service runs separately and handles Ask a Friend links.

`src/server.mjs` creates and connects services, applies request checks and dispatches routes. Domain modules take explicit dependencies; they do not import the server or Electron. The desktop main process owns server startup and shutdown. The interface has no direct Node.js or filesystem access.

## Repository layout

```text
src/        Local server, workspace services, agent adapters and provider worker
desktop/    Electron lifecycle, preload bridge and packaging tools
public/     Browser interface and static assets served by the local server
sharing/    Independently deployable private-link service and its tests
test/       Application tests and mock agents
assets/     Shipped branding and application icons
docs/       Architecture, user guide and screenshots
```

The local backend lives in `src/` so the repository root stays focused on project information, package configuration and the public installer. This is a source-directory convention, not a Node.js requirement: [npm supports explicit entry points and scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json/). The directories above follow the application's existing runtime and deployment boundaries. Source modules retain explicit imports and dependencies; this layout adds no build step or framework. Split modules or introduce feature subdirectories when their responsibilities require it.

`src/server.mjs` resolves static assets and the default development `.data/` directory relative to the application root, independent of the working directory. Moving source files must not move saved history. `src/broker.mjs` locates its sibling provider worker relative to its own module URL, so worker startup also works from a packaged app or another workspace. The sharing container copies only its service, public assets and the portable format module from `src/`.

Disposable generated assets belong in `output/`, which is excluded from Git and desktop packages.

## Interface ownership

`public/app.js` owns workspace selection, conversation state, the composer, requests and the live event connection. It exposes `window.relayUI`; feature scripts use that API and listen for `relay-state` rather than keeping separate copies of the active workspace or conversation.

| Feature script | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `insights.js` | Model and effort controls, run progress, account usage and Git activity |
| `conversation-history.js` | Previous-chat discovery, selection, review, merge and export |
| `setup.js` | Onboarding and saved preferences; announces `relay-setup-ready` after initial setup state loads |
| `updates.js` | In-app release notes after updates and from Help; waits for setup and workspace loading |
| `model-picker.js` | Searchable cloud/local selection, workspace-scoped catalog requests and normal composer integration |
| `local-models.js` | Explicit local-model selection, task handoff and setup guidance |
| `files.js` | File explorer, previews and attachments |
| `conversation-search.js` | Find in the conversation: match highlights, the match count and moving between matches |
| `agent-review.js` | Cross-agent review selection, explicit preview/start, findings and fix drafts |
| `workbench.js` | Ask a Friend review flow |
| `desktop-controls.js` | Native keep-awake controls |

The deferred scripts in `index.html` load the core API before its features, and history before setup can announce readiness. New scripts and styles also need an entry in the server's explicit static-asset allowlist. Interface tests exercise the actual scripts; HTTP tests check that the page's scripts and styles are served.

## State and operations

Each workspace has a stable ID, attached folder records and one permanent conversation ID in `projects.json`. Conversation events live in per-workspace JSONL journals; reopening a workspace replays those events. Preferences live in `settings.json`. Electron keeps this data under its user-data directory; browser-only development uses `.data/` by default. CLI credentials remain managed by the installed agents. The guide describes the user-facing storage and migration behavior.

### Permission policies and tool approvals

Throughline tracks two explicit permission policies: `ask` (default) and `auto` (Full auto-approval).
- Policy validation: `checkSettings(provider, mode, approvalPolicy)` in `src/broker.mjs` ensures that only valid policies (`ask`, `auto`) are accepted. Combining `mode === 'read'` with `approvalPolicy === 'auto'` is strictly incompatible and rejected with a 400 permission error.
- Workspace scoping: Every new conversation defaults to manual permissions (`approvalPolicy: 'ask'`). Policy changes are recorded in the workspace journal. Importing external transcripts or conversations never copies or overrides the permission setting.
- Run lifecycle and immutability: When a run starts, its `approvalPolicy` is captured in the submission record and bound to `run.approvalPolicy`. In-flight runs retain their policy regardless of subsequent settings changes. Existing pending requests retain their current policy.
- Auto-approval handling: In `run.approvalPolicy === 'auto'`, tool approval requests emitted over worker IPC are approved automatically by the broker, emitting an activity log to the conversation. Provider adapters (`runCodex`, `runClaude`, `runGemini`) allow tool execution directly without manual user confirmation. Read-only mode denies tool execution regardless of approval policy.

A submitted message carries a request ID so retrying after a lost response does not run the same task twice. The broker records the submission, starts a provider worker and turns worker events into journal entries and live updates. The UI refreshes the corresponding workspace and rejects stale responses after selection changes.

Google personal accounts use the official Antigravity ACP runtime (1.4.5+), installed explicitly from Google’s pinned archive with a verified checksum. Both the server and matching harness are kept in the application data folder, with an isolated `GEMINI_HOME` profile. The runtime owns personal OAuth; ambient API keys, ADC and Antigravity bypass variables are removed. Metadata sessions in an empty app-owned folder read account/model/effort information without prompts; the account and model checks share one runtime start, and a signed-in result is reused for a minute. The runtime reaches Google through a loopback relay (`src/google-relay.mjs`) because some networks stall TLS to Google over IPv6 and the runtime never falls back: the relay accepts only token-authenticated `CONNECT` tunnels to Google hosts on port 443, connects over IPv4 before IPv6, never sees inside the TLS stream, and steps aside when the user has configured a proxy. Each coding session confirms the `default` approval mode and requested model/effort before sending; only one-time tool approvals are granted. User questions are rejected instead of being treated as tool approvals. Antigravity’s native workspace-trust and hooks remain active; it does not expose a verified read-only mode in this connection, so read-only work and background reviews use Codex or Claude. Plain headless `agy` remains blocked. Gemini CLI 0.66.0+ is retained as an explicit advanced API/enterprise connection using isolated per-run policy, restricted read tools, one-time edits/commands and workspace-bounded text-file proxies. No authentication, billing or entitlement is inferred from cached account names or invented model lists.

Continue locally uses Codex as the tool harness and Ollama as the model provider. Its dedicated route validates the approved workspace, access mode and downloaded-model digest. Internal broker options select a fresh local run without changing cloud settings or sessions; ordinary message bodies cannot enable them. The adapter rechecks local model metadata, pins the loopback Responses endpoint, requires the native client to confirm the local provider before sending a task, disables hosted search/MCP and provider telemetry for this invocation, and retains native approvals, cancellation and mutation leases. The application journal remains canonical; local Codex threads are ephemeral. Reply metadata and conversation exports retain local-model attribution.

Cross-agent reviews reuse that same run lifecycle, workspace mutation lease, billing gate, cancellation and provider adapters. Review requests are created by the dedicated route module; ordinary message bodies cannot enable the broker's internal review options. A review forces read-only access and a fresh provider session, preserves coding preferences, and never stores or advances the provider's normal coding session. The journal stores the selected diffs and their file-content/Git-base identities with the review submission, then a validated result record. Snapshot validation is repeated after acquiring the mutation lease. Review callbacks deny write/command approvals; existing native provider read-only policies remain in force.

Review findings must parse as a bounded JSON report with known severities, selected-file identities and valid line numbers. Invalid reports stay explicitly unstructured. Conversation responses expose compact review metadata; the scoped review endpoint supplies captured diffs and checks freshness. Fix preparation accepts finding IDs from a completed, current review and returns a draft without starting a provider. The interface uses text nodes for all agent-supplied review content and guards responses against workspace changes.

The registry coordinates workspace membership and brokers. File guards protect registry writes, project locks protect conversation ownership, and mutation leases prevent conflicting agent and patch operations on overlapping folders. New guards record PID/start identity in unique owner-marker filenames. A recovery process must atomically claim the exact dead owner’s marker before retiring its directory; competing recoverers cannot remove a replacement guard. Live owners are never expired by age, and empty legacy or unrecognized guards remain fail-closed. Shutdown waits for brokers and active mutations before releasing their locks.

Context envelopes use an intent-first byte budget in `src/context.mjs`. Current input and manual context are validated before inference. The first substantive user request and eight latest substantive instructions are protected before selecting assistant text; generated Continue requests do not displace task intent. Tool activity is allocated at most a small fraction of the envelope and uses explicit head/tail excerpts. Selection preserves chronological order and full journals, budgets JSON escaping and UTF-8, and reserves image-index space before selecting history. Run context metadata records inclusion, omission, shortening and session provenance. No model call is made to summarize history.

Consecutive same-agent turns may resume a current Codex/Claude native session with unseen shared messages. After another provider or a local run, explicit Continue, or folder membership changes, the broker reconstructs a fresh session from the canonical journal and resets the incoming provider's stale checkpoint only after accepting the submission. Gemini always uses a fresh ACP session. The handoff envelope identifies the previous run's provider, status and failure category; these are historical evidence, and the incoming agent must inspect current files. Read-only, billing and permission checks stay independent of session selection.

History discovery reads metadata. Selecting a source loads a preview; merging rechecks its approved digest and records the selected text without starting an agent. Source IDs prevent duplicate imported messages. Export defaults remove possible secrets and local paths. Collaboration similarly keeps review, approval and patch application explicit.

## Extending the app

Add agent protocols through `src/providers.mjs` and the worker, retaining the broker's normalized events, approvals, cancellation and journal semantics. Keep new HTTP features behind the existing server checks and pass their dependencies into a dedicated route module.

The planned [project command controls](https://github.com/AhmedNavaz/throughline/issues/47) and [integrated terminal](https://github.com/AhmedNavaz/throughline/issues/7) should share a dedicated process/session manager, with separate interface modules for command output and the interactive shell. Start with saved Run/Test/Stop actions, then add the terminal. Resolve workspace and folder IDs through the registry, own child processes, retain sessions when the panel is hidden or workspaces change, and stop them on session close or app shutdown. A user-operated shell is separate from an agent run and its read-only setting. Define interaction with overlapping agent and patch operations while allowing a development server to remain running during edits; send output to the conversation only when the user selects it.

For changes, run `npm test` and `npm run test:desktop`. Tests use temporary folders and mock agents. Add coverage for state transitions and process cleanup when those behaviors change; tests must not use live accounts or saved user history.

Background review routes explicitly opt into a separate broker and private snapshot directory. Canonical review records and request fingerprints remain in the workspace journal; normal coding sessions and last-run state are independent. Snapshot jobs have their own Stop action, a bounded global count and shutdown cleanup. Folder removal/membership checks reject active reviews before persisting changes. Worker events publish phase/tool-count progress; report freshness always checks the live source before preparing fixes. Only approved selected files are copied, and raw responses are bounded. Legacy direct review calls retain their existing behavior.

Google account quota is read through the pinned official ACP runtime’s built-in `/usage` handler, which intercepts the command before agent inference. The reader uses an empty metadata workspace, denies tool requests, bounds the report and declines unverified runtime versions. Native quota groups and buckets are parsed independently from session token usage; missing data never creates percentages. Cache keys include the executable and Google profile, and account connect/disconnect invalidates the cache.
