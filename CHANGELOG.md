# Changelog

Notable changes to Throughline. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- A new first-run experience: a launch screen, an animated welcome, three short setup steps and a summary, then the app fades in.
- A newly installed copy that finds saved workspaces asks whether to continue with them or start fresh. Starting fresh keeps the old data as a backup.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-30

First public release.

### Added

- Workspaces with one or more folders and one permanent conversation, shared by Claude Code and Codex.
- Switch agents mid-task without losing context, for example when one reaches its usage limit.
- Import existing Claude Code and Codex chats from any project, merged in time order.
- Export a conversation file for another Throughline user, with secrets and local paths redacted.
- Ask a Friend: share an approved snapshot and apply the reviewable patch that comes back.
- Git activity with per-file diffs, a file browser with syntax highlighting, and plan usage for each agent.
- Keep awake, which stops your Mac sleeping while agents are working.
- Dark and light themes, keyboard shortcuts and a short setup guide.
- macOS builds for Apple Silicon and Intel, and a container image for the private-link service.
